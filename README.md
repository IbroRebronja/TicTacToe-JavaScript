# TicTacToe Game

This is a simple implementation of the classic TicTacToe game using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It provides a user-friendly interface for playing TicTacToe against another player locally in a web browser.

## Features

- **Responsive Design:** The game interface is designed to adapt to various screen sizes, making it playable on both desktop and mobile devices.
- **Two Player Mode:** Play against a friend locally. Take turns placing your marks (X or O) on the grid until someone wins or the game ends in a draw.
- **Win Detection:** The game automatically detects when a player wins by achieving three marks in a row (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally) and displays the winner.
- **Draw Detection:** If all cells on the grid are filled and there is no winner, the game ends in a draw.
- **Restart Option:** After a game ends (either with a win or draw), players have the option to restart and play again without refreshing the page.

## Usage

- Start playing TicTacToe by clicking on the cells to place your marks (X or O).
